# Dept_Health_Analysis
This Repository is my Semester Project in Data Science and Advanced Programming.

This project implements a machine-learning pipeline to predict sovereign debt crises using macroeconomic data.
The code is organized in a modular and reproducible way, separating data construction, modeling, and evaluation.

# Folder and File description

# data/

Contains all datasets used in the project.
# data/raw/
Stores raw input data (IMF WEO macroeconomic data and global crisis data).
These files are never modified by the code.
# data/processed/
Stores cleaned and processed datasets generated by the pipeline, including:
	a clean country–year macroeconomic panel
	a merged macro–crisis dataset with prediction targets
These files are created automatically when running the pipeline.

# src/

Contains the core logic of the project.
# data_loader.py
Handles all data construction tasks: loading raw data, cleaning, handling missing values, merging macroeconomic and crisis data, and creating forward-looking crisis indicators.
# models.py
Contains all model training functions, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with consistent train–test splitting.
# evaluation.py
Handles model evaluation, performance metrics, plots, and interpretability tools (e.g. SHAP).

# results/

Contains all outputs produced by the pipeline.
# results/chrono/
Results based on time-consistent (chronological) train–test splits, reflecting realistic forecasting conditions.
# results/random/
Results based on random splits, used only for robustness checks.

Each results folder contains metrics, predictions, plots, and saved trained models.

# main.py

Entry point of the project.
Runs the full pipeline: data construction, model training, evaluation, and saving of results.

# environment.yml

Defines the Python environment and dependencies required to run the project and ensure reproducibility.

# Running the Project

After setting up the environment, the full pipeline can be executed with:
python main.py

All processed data and results are generated automatically.
